## [Library.js](charcoding.github.io/library.js)
A random, mostly pronounceable<sup>[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>, English<sup>[<i>clarification needed</i>]</sup> word generator.

This is originally made because my friend [raptorcode](https://github.com/raptorcode/) needed a country/city name generator.

How to use:
```
word(iteration, option);
```
where ```iteration``` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10 and ```option``` is either ```"country"```, or ```"city"```.

I also added a string method called ```capitalize```.
```
'charcoding'.capitalize(); // 'Charcoding'
```
We thought of this ambiguous name because of the [tweet](https://twitter.com/ironshay/status/370525864523743232?lang=en) which described a drinking game:

>Drinking game for web devs: 
>1) Think of a noun
>2) Google "\<noun>.js"
>3) If a library with that name exists - drink

And after a while we are surprised to find that no JavaScript library with the name "library". Now that this is created, more drinking for developers that dared to play the drinking game.
